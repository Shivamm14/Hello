/*
 TODO
 Implementing players individual score.
 Implementing turn taking of players.
 Using getNextPlayer() method in Team class to get next player to play.
 Using canPlay attribute in player to get its state of whether can play or not.

 // Design decision: Would it be better to do the batter and runner inside the team itself with out exposing it in
    the Game class?
 TODO:
 Implementing Batsman and Bowler.
 Implementing constructor of Game to allow for setting overs by client.
 Edge case of hasNext. What last two are playing and no one is left on the bench. It stops. Is it right?
 Ans: Might have to remove the condition hasNext from the while loop in matchStart and put it in the wicket part of else

 TODO:
 enum for type of ball: normal, noBall, wideBall
 enum for type of run: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Wicket
 - Writing Batsman and Bowler specific fields.

 - Considering putting the playing methods of Team class in separate PlayMatch class.
 - Using txt file to load team and players data. Will be helpful in adding database.
 - Organising the code in better way. Writing more descriptive commits. Creating new branches for features.
 - Write method for showing match state after each ball.
 - Considering the immutability of internal objects. for eg. batter's attribute can be change by clients.
 - Relating to making defensively copying and returning the copy object.
 - making defensive copies to make internal player objects inaccessible by clients
 - Then have to consider the player's batsman or bowler type. ? what will be the effect of copies.
 - Then have to also change getters of players attributes in Team to return copies instead of actual player.

 Possible issues in adding features later on.
 - Replacing batsman and bowler  with players.
//

TODO
- To include bowler in giving runs and wicket, considering making methods in Team class, itself.
  similar to increaseScore method for batting team.

- Considered adding runsMade and runsGiven attributes in Batsman and Bowler, but that will restrict choosing a batsman
 to bowl, and vice versa. Since they are interchangeable.

- 1. Take input from file.
- 2. storing overs details. Done
- 3. firstInningsOvers, secondInningOvers. Done
- 4. Over - list of balls. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, W Done
- 5. Adding bowler data. - adding currentBowler in Team, and runsGiven and wicketsTaken Done. // nextBowler.
- 6. My design decision is based on not exposing players of Team outside. Doing everything inside Team.
- 7. Modifying getRuns for Batsman and Bowler.
- 8. Storing data in database. What to store? Scoreboard, match details,
